        <h3>Addendum</h3>

        Applying custom styles allows you to customize heading widths and paragraph styles that aren't specifically covered in the supplied CSS. Tailoring these components improves readability and visual hierarchy, allowing the visitor to easily go from section headings to the in-depth information. Here's how to change the font styles and sizes for improved reading and organization.
        Font Selections
        sans-serif arial font: Selected due to its extensive accessibility and readable nature. Sans-serif fonts are a wonderful option for online resumes because they are typically easier to see on screens.
        In order to create a distinct hierarchy, the sizes get smaller from h1 to h3. Smaller headings indicate subsections, while larger headings highlight section begins.
        Web content frequently uses a font size of 16 px because it balances readability with effective space utilization.
        Background hues:
        Body (#ffffe0): The light yellow background contrasts subtly with the text to create a warm and inviting atmosphere that is easy on the eyes.
        Header (#90ee90): The light green color of the header indicates the beginning of the document and separates it from the main content section.
        Article (#ffcc99): The light orange color of the article sections makes a soft, distinct reading area that improves focus.
        Text Colors:
        General Text (#333): Dark gray relieves eye strain by providing a gentler contrast than pure black.
        Headings (#007BFF): Using blue for headings gives them a splash of color that enhances navigation and draws attention.
        Options for Padding and Margin
        Body: Margins and padding are not specified; however, they can be changed to suit alignment and general spacing needs.
        Header and Articles: Padding makes the information more readable by allowing room to be created inside these parts.
        Tables: Tabulated data is easier to read when there is padding inside the cells and border-spacing or border-collapse between them.
